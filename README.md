# ðŸ“§ Spam Detection Using Machine Learning & NLP

This project demonstrates how to build a **Spam Detection System** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)**. The system classifies SMS messages as either **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)** using various ML models.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Overview

Spam messages are a major nuisance, and detecting them accurately is a crucial task in the field of machine learning. This project focuses on:

- Cleaning and preprocessing text data.
- Extracting features using **TF-IDF vectorization**.
- Training ML models to classify messages.
- Comparing performance of different classifiers.

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.x  
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`, `numpy` â€“ data manipulation
  - `nltk` â€“ natural language processing
  - `sklearn` â€“ machine learning algorithms and evaluation
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` â€“ visualization

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset used is a publicly available collection of **SMS messages** labeled as either **spam** or **ham**.

- **Features**: Raw text message
- **Label**: Spam / Ham

## ðŸ§  ML Models Used

- **Naive Bayes**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

Each model is evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix
